###Introduction
This project aims to be a transcription and revision of some exercises that
are relevant to the course of Mathematical Analysis 1, with the aim of enriching and refining the understanding of the topics covered. The exercises solved are three, due
to the demonstration of two inequalities, the first and the second are
a specific case of the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means (AM-GM
inequality). The third exercise concerns a fractional function, and an extensive study
of its properties
